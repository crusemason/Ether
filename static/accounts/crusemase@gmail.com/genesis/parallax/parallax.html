			In 1970, the National Science Foundation began research on implanting a computer chip directly into a human brain. This was followed by a contract from Defense Agency Research Projects Agency. After years of testing on animals, in the mid 1990s the first computer chips were implanted in humans. High-speed brain-computer interface is a computer chip implanted into the cerebral cortex allowing users to communicate with a computer wirelessly from their thoughts. Currently, the most common application of a BCI is the ability to control a computer cursor directly through thoughts. This functionality can be extrapolated into unimaginable applications. One of these applications gives paralized users the ability to control prosthetic limbs, and cure other ailments. “Neuralink Corporation is an American neurotechnology company founded by Elon Musk and others, developing implantable brain–machine interfaces (BMIs). The company  was started in 2016 and was first publicly reported in March 2017” (Winkler). “Neuralink announced that it was working on a "sewing machine-like" device capable of implanting very thin threads into the brain, demonstrated a system that read information from a lab rat via 1500 electrodes (said to be 15 times more than the current maximum for systems used in human brains), and anticipated to start experiments with humans in 2020” (Markoff). This technology is already here, and will be improving at an exponential rate due to Artificial Intelligence.
